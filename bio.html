        <p> Born and raised in Mississippi, 
            <br> (and now living in Mannheim, Germany)
            <br> I truly believe in being helpful to others 
            <br> but also that, we have to help ourselves
            <br> by working hard for what we want in life.
            <br>             
            <br> With that attitude, I charged forward  
            <br>  into life to achieve success.
            <br>
            <br> This journey has helped me to live in many cities in 
            <br> the USA and Germany. I've experienced a diverse
            <br> spectrum of cultures in my work and private life.
            <br>
            <br> These experiences have honed my communication   
            <br> and problem-solving skills, as well as,  
            <br> my adaptiveness and flexible thinking.   
            <br>
            <br> I'm an highly driven and independent person but 
            <br> also have been an important component to many  
            <br> successful teams, ranging from varsity sports  
            <br> to record breaking retail teams. 
            <br>
            <br> I recently gained my Full-Stack Web and App  
            <br> Developer certification, which along with my  
            <br> Project Management certificaton(s) and experiences,   
            <br> are a good knowledge base for a successful
            <br> career in Web Devlopment.
            <br>
            <br> I am excited about conquering the daily   
            <br> challenges which await me on the job,   
            <br> while building upon my pro skills 
            <br> as a professional developer.
            <br>
            <br> If you are looking for UI developer who 
            <br> is a team player and wants to grow while  
            <br> achieving company goals, feel free 
            <br> to reach out to me.
            <br>
            <br> Thank you.
        </p>
